Today I was wondering how to send tasks from my work computer (I'm running Ubuntu) to [Due][due] (iOS).
As the day passed by I remembered a python script I built some time ago that uses the service [Pushover][pushover] to send bits of text to my device. And as a matter of fact it supports URLs in its messages.

<!--more-->

So I tought, I could build a script that uses that service to accomplish my needs.

After some minutes I ended up with this:

{% gist 8030079 %}

Of course the script can be better, such as every other script I write, but I agree with what [Dr. Drang][drdrang] wrote in [this post][post]

> ...but that’s not why I don’t like it. I don’t like it because it follows a trend I see in lots of scripts: it uses object orientation for no particularly good reason.

To Summarize - Why use complex object orientation classes for such a simple task?

Hope someone finds it useful.
